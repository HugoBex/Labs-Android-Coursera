 Project - iRemember - Part 1: Instructions

Note: This assignment will be graded together with your work on Part 2. As a result, this assignment writeup has no associated due date or grade. It is only intended as a way to provide you with the materials that you will need to start the project.

In this project you will put some of the things you've learned in the course to use.

You will create a simple application that allows users to capture and replay, location-based stories.

You can also view a simple screencast of the basic app.
