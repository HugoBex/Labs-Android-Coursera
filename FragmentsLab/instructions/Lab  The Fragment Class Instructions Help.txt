 Lab  The Fragment Class Instructions Help

In this lab you will experiment with the Fragment Class.

You will create a simple application that uses Fragments to produce either a multi-pane or single-pane user interface depending on the current device’s screen size. After completing this lab you should better understand the Fragment class and its lifecycle, and how Fragments interact with the Activities that host them.
